	<h2>Evan Yandell</h2>
	<p>
		Evan started programming on his TI-83+ graphing calculator in highschool because he got tired of entering the same complex equations over and over again.  This desire to eliminate tedious labor from his and others\' lives combined with a lifelong interest in learning how things work has given Evan knowledge in a wide range of topics which he is eager to apply.  Evan is attentive to detail to the point of obsession and is persistent in pursuing solutions to complex problems.  Evan currently works doing scripting work and database maintenence and in his off hours enjoys reading, tinkering with software and learning more about whatever he finds most interesting at the moment.
