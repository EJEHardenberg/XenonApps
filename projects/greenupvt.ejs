	<p>
		Each year the State of Vermont holds "Green-up" events
where volunteers spend part of a spring day cleaning up litter and other
found waste. The event is highly publicized and a great service to the
community: picking up hazardous trash like needles, and cleaning up
discarded alcohol containers makes Vermont's streets that much safer for
everyone. 
	</p>
	<p>
But while the event is greatly beneficial, organization of volunteers is
not always optimal. Little or no direction on where to clean, where to
drop off their collected garbage, and what areas are "high-need" results
in teams overlapping cleaned zones and bags of garbage left out on the
streets. For some, this leaves a feeling of "you're on your own", once
the volunteers have been given their bags.

		During the National Day of Civic Hacking held on 6/22/13, a core group of Xenon Developers began work on a solution to the problem:
	</p>
	<p>
		We sought to address the core problems we saw and outlined the 
		requirements of the application. We needed: to know what had been
		cleaned already; a way for staff to notify volunteers of high-need
		areas; and a way to allow people to communicate with each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		What we created is an application that does exactly this in the 
		palm of your hand. A phone application that shows users, in real
		time, how green vermont is getting from their efforts. Allowing
		users to communicate via a Twitter-esk stream with an interface
		that ties user messages to places on a map. In addition to the
		phone application, we created an administrative dashboard for
		the Green Up organization to interact with the device users. 
		Allowing them to drop markers on the map to direct volunteers
		to locations needing more help, as well as to moderate the forum
		feed for any offensive commentary.
