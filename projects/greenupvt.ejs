				Each year the State of Vermont holds Green-up VT events where volunteers spend part of a spring day cleaning up litter and other found waste, but while the event is highly publicized, the organization of the clean-up tasks themselves are ad-hoc and disorganized. Volunteers are given little or no directions regarding where to clean or where to drop off the collected refuse. Furthermore, there is no coordination between volunteers and the central organization about "high-need" areas. This lack of coordination leads to overlapping zones covered (wasted time), bags of garbage left where they won't be collected, and an overall feeling of "you're on your own", once the volunteers have been given their bags.

				During the National Day of Civic Hacking held on 6/22/13, a core group of Xenon Developers began work on a solution to the problem:
			</p>
			<p>
				An application that allows volunteers to collect and distribute information with each other and with a central team, about high-need locations (lots of garbage to collect), ground already covered, and drop-off locations for collected waste. The application is available currently as a mobile website, however we are in development of both Android and iOS native applications.
